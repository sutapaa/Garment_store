Gathering knowledge about Slicer,Drill up & Drill down, Tool tip, KPI etc.

**Insights from the Dashboard**
As Set and kurta type of garments are the most amount generated items, we can give discount or any kind of coupon on buying of more than two products. This will attract more traffic.
Amazon(34%) & Myntra(24%) attracts the most of the traffic.
As we can see in the stacked area chart in the year end sold quantity is quite low so we can run any kind of sale in the most of the channels.
Churaha, Elgaid, Chainpur, Naharlagun, Vrindavan(Mathura) are the lowest selling cities.
